## Overview
The Beam Authorization application allows the Director of Operations (or a delegate) to clearly communicate and document the maximum current and beam mode ("permissions") that are authorized for a given beam destination.  This information is stored in a database and presented via the web for easy access.   There are three machines, each with their own set of beam destinations and beam modes: CEBAF, LERF, UITF.  In addition to director authorization, the app also tracks Credited Controls and their verification.  Each beam destination is assigned a set of controls and each control is assigned to a particular responsible group.  A beam desintation is ready for beam only if all the controls assigned are verified by their responsible group.  Both group verifications and director permissions have expirations.   Emails and Jefferson Lab logbook entires are created to aid communication of new director permissions, responsible group verifications (upgrades and downgrades), and verification and permissions expirations.

### Roles
 - **Operations Director** - Responsible for authorizing beam
 - **Operability / Admin** - Responsible for process administration and continuous improvement
 - **Operator** - Must honor permissions set by the Director when running the machines
 - **Group Leader** - Responsible for verifying Credited Control readiness and assigning expiration dates for when new checks are required

## Install
This application requires a Java 11+ JVM and standard library to run, plus a Java EE 8+ application server (developed with Wildfly).

1. Install service [dependencies](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/bam/blob/main/deps.yaml)
2. Download [Wildfly 26.1.3](https://www.wildfly.org/downloads/)
3. [Configure](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/bam#configure) Wildfly and start it
4. Download [bam.war](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/bam/releases) and deploy it to Wildfly
5. Navigate your web browser to [localhost:8080/bam](http://localhost:8080/bam)

## Configure

### Configtime
Wildfly must be pre-configured before the first deployment of the app.  The [wildfly bash scripts](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/wildfly#configure) can be used to accomplish this.  See the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/bam/blob/main/Dockerfile) for an example.

### Runtime
Uses the [Smoothness Environment Variables](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/smoothness#global-runtime) plus the following application specific:

| Name                              | Description                                                                                                                                 |

| BAM_UPCOMING_EXPIRATION_EMAIL_CSV | Comma separated list of email recipients of both expired and upcoming expirations (admin heads-up email)                                    |
| BAM_EXPIRED_EMAIL_CSV             | Comma separated list of email recipients of expired permissions and control verifications (ops semi-synchronous notification of expiration) |
| BAM_DOWNGRADED_EMAIL_CSV          | Comma separated list of email recipients for control verifications downgrades                                                               |
| BAM_PERMISSIONS_SUBJECT           | Subject of log entries and emails indicating permissions updated                                                                            |

### Database
The Beam Auth application requires an Oracle 18+ database with the following [schema](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/bam/tree/main/docker/oracle/setup) installed.   The application server hosting the Beam Auth app must also be configured with a JNDI datasource.

## Build
This project is built with [Java 17](https://adoptium.net/) (compiled to Java 11 bytecode), and uses the [Gradle 7](https://gradle.org/) build tool to automatically download dependencies and build the project from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/JeffersonLab/bam
cd bam
gradlew build
```
**Note**: If you do not already have Gradle installed, it will be installed automatically by the wrapper script included in the source

**Note for JLab On-Site Users**: Jefferson Lab has an intercepting [proxy](https://gist.github.com/slominskir/92c25a033db93a90184a5994e71d0b78)

**See**: [Docker Development Quick Reference](https://gist.github.com/slominskir/a7da801e8259f5974c978f9c3091d52c#development-quick-reference)

## Develop
In order to iterate rapidly when making changes it's often useful to run the app directly on the local workstation, perhaps leveraging an IDE.  In this scenario run the service dependencies with:
```
docker compose -f deps.yaml up
```
**Note**: The local install of Wildfly should be [configured](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/bam#configure) to proxy connections to services via localhost and therefore the environment variables should contain:
```
KEYCLOAK_BACKEND_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8081
FRONTEND_SERVER_URL=https://localhost:8443
```
Further, the local DataSource must also leverage localhost port forwarding so the `standalone.xml` connection-url field should be: `jdbc:oracle:thin:@//localhost:1521/xepdb1`.  

The [server](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/wildfly/blob/main/scripts/server-setup.sh) and [app](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/wildfly/blob/main/scripts/app-setup.sh) setup scripts can be used to setup a local instance of Wildfly. 

## Release
1. Bump the version number and release date in build.gradle and commit and push to GitHub (using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)).
2. Create a new release on the GitHub Releases page corresponding to the same version in the build.gradle.   The release should enumerate changes and link issues.   A war artifact can be attached to the release to facilitate easy install by users.
3. [Publish to DockerHub](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/bam/actions/workflows/docker-publish.yml) GitHub Action should run automatically.
4. Bump and commit quick start [image version](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/bam/blob/main/docker-compose.override.yml)

## Deploy
At JLab this app is found at [ace.jlab.org/bam](https://ace.jlab.org/bam) and internally at [acctest.acc.jlab.org/bam](https://acctest.acc.jlab.org/bam).  However, those servers are proxies for `wildfly5.acc.jlab.org` and `wildflytest5.acc.jlab.org` respectively.   A [deploy script](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/wildfly/blob/main/scripts/deploy.sh) is provided to automate wget and deploy.  Example:

```
/root/setup/deploy.sh bam v1.2.3
```
