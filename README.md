# beam-auth
Beam authorization app

## Build
This [Java](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) project uses the [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) build tool to automatically download dependencies and build the project from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/JeffersonLab/beam-auth
cd beam-auth
gradlew build
```
**Note**: If you do not already have Gradle installed, it will be installed automatically by the wrapper script included in the source
